# Alpha Tech Mini Projects

Welcome to the **Alpha Tech Mini Projects** repository! This collection includes a variety of small but powerful tools and algorithms designed by Alpha Tech Solutions to solve complex problems efficiently. Whether you're looking for educational resources or practical utilities, this repository has something to offer.

## Projects Included

### 1. Expression Tree Evaluator
The **Expression Tree Evaluator** is a tool that converts mathematical expressions into a tree structure for efficient and intuitive evaluation. This method is widely used in compilers, calculators, and other computational tools.

- **Features:**
  - Converts mathematical expressions into a tree structure.
  - Evaluates complex expressions accurately.
  - Visualizes the expression tree (upcoming feature).
  
- **Applications:**
  - **Compilers:** Parse and evaluate expressions in programming languages.
  - **Calculators:** Foundation for advanced calculators.
  - **Optimization:** Restructures expressions for performance.
  - **Artificial Intelligence:** Used in symbolic AI for reasoning and problem-solving.
